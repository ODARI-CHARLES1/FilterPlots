# 🎛️ Filter Plots Visualization

A simple project to visualize the input and output of signal filters in both the time and frequency domains. This includes waveforms, magnitude response, and phase response — essential tools for understanding how filters affect signals.

---

## 📈 Overview

This project generates three key plots for a given input and output signal:

- **Waveform Plot**: Shows the input and output signals over time.
- **Magnitude Response**: Plots the gain (magnitude) of the filter across frequencies (ω).
- **Phase Response**: Plots the phase shift introduced by the filter across frequencies (ω).

These plots are useful for analyzing filters such as low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and notch filters in signal processing applications.

## 📦 Features

- Visual comparison of input vs. output waveforms.
- Magnitude and phase plotting in the frequency domain.
- Supports custom signals and filter configurations.
- Lightweight and easy to run.
