## Visualization of Input and Output signal characteristics in terms of phase,magnitude and angular frequency (LOW PASS FILTER)

The three graphs below visualize the input and output signal characteristics in terms of their waveforms, magnitude response, and phase response:

- **1st Graph**: Plot of the input and output signal waveforms over time.  
- **2nd Graph**: Plot of magnitude vs. angular frequency (Ï‰).  
- **3rd Graph**: Plot of phase vs. angular frequency (Ï‰).
